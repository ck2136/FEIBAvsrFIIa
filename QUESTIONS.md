# Questions

1. What is the time horizon for the whole study?
	-We are only looking at the 5 day (acute inpatient setting)
	- Rationale for 5 days: Most common clinical
	- Population

2. What do you want as the cycle length? I thouth about 12 hours but I don't know what would be appropriate...
	- Blood paper Table 4


3. Since we have the 3 month probabilities from the Borg 2015 study I translated them to 1 week. This isn't the final probability we will be using unless you want the cycles to be 1 week long. Let me know your thoughts on the cycles!
	-We are going to use differential cycle length (different dosese per patient by treatments)
